Branches are used to point to specific commits, by using branches developers can work on the code in parallel and in isolation from the main codebase. Branches also make provide version control allowing developers to track changes overtime in a safe environment without risking the main codebase.

5.
git status displays the state of the current branch, the changes not staged for commit, and untracked files. While git log displays the commit history of the current branch.

I) Inheritance is the ability of one class to be derived from another. Where the "child" class inherits the "parent" class's properties and methods/functions.
II) Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take many forms/types so that a single interface can represent differing underlying forms/types which can be treated uniformly.
III) Encapsulation is the concept that groups attributes and methods/functions that operate on those attributes into a single unit, such as a class.

9.
"Dictator and Lieutenants" (D.L.) workflow have a central repository that everyone pulls from but only the dictator can push to the central repository. "Integration manager" (I.M.) workflow has each developer push to their own public repository and the integration manager handles the central repository.

10.
Because the "Centralized" workflow as all the developers pushing and pulling fromt the same shared repository integration conflicts and miscommunications are highly likely due to the number of developers on the team D.L. workflow allows only one developer to push to the repository thus allowing them to handle the integration of all the others' work without creating conflicts in the central repository. The shared repository would be updated so frequently that it would be nearly impossible to have an up-to-date private repository or ensure that pushes would not conflict.
